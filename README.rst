Usage
=====

API
---

Base endpoints
**************

1. ``/api/v1/likes/list/`` - List API View to return all likes for authenticated user.
    
    You can set ``serializer`` for each model in ``LIKES_MODELS`` setting to use it for content object serialization, otherwise, you will get an id of content object.  

    For example:

    .. code:: python

        LIKE_MODELS = {
            "article.Article": {
                'serializer': 'article.api.serializers.ArticleSerializer'
            },
        }


    Use ``GET`` parameter ``search`` to filter by a content type's model:
    `/api/v1/likes/list/?search=article`

2. ``/api/v1/likes/count/`` - API View to return count of likes for authenticated user.

3. ``/api/v1/likes/is/`` - API View to check is given elements are liked by authenticated user. As result, you will get a list of ``ids``.  

    Possible payload:

    .. code:: json

        {
            "content_type": 1,
            "ids": [1,2,3]
        }
    

    Possible result:

    .. code:: json

        {
            "ids": [1,3]
        }
    

4. ``/api/v1/likes/toggle/`` - API View to like-unlike a given object by authenticated user.  
    
    Possible payload:

    .. code:: json

        {
            "content_type": 1,
            "id": 1
        }
